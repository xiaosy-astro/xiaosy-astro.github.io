Schematic illustration of (a) a black hole-disk-corona model including thermal, Compton, and reflection components, and (b) a black hole disk model with reflection component from self-irradiation of the disk (thermal returning) and iterative reflection (reflection returning). The color
gradient in the disk indicates that the temperature increases towards the black hole.
