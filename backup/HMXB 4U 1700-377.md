Fig. 4. Summary of the fit results. From top to bottom, the modulation
curves in phase D and F, the X-ray count rate, PD (2–8 keV), PD (2–4
keV), PD (4–8 keV), column density, photon index, and normalization of
the powerlaw. The hatch marks in the PD (2–8 keV) panel represent the
MDP for each time interval. The three colors indicating variability are the
same as in Figure 3. Alt Text: Summary plot of spectral fit results over
time
